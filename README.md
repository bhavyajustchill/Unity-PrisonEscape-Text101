# Plot
Your name is Mr. Bhavya. Your look-alike criminal escaped from prison last night, and next day you are spotted and mistaken for your look-alike criminal and so you end up in prison. You were beaten up during your arrest and you wake up in your cell, which stinks heavily. You ask yourself, 'Can I Escape from this HELL?!'
